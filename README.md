# Jumpstarting the Raspberry Pi Zero W

This repository contains all the code used in the book
*Jumpstarting the Raspberry Pi Zero W*, by Akkana Peck, from Make: Books.

Plus some extra Raspberry Pi programs just for fun.

Wiring diagrams corresponding to code can be found in the *images*
directory. They were made with Fritzing, and you'll find the source files
in the *fritzing* directory.

I also have some older Raspberry Pi scripts in the
['rpi' section of my scripts repository](https://github.com/akkana/scripts/tree/master/rpi)
and in my
[motioncam](https://github.com/akkana/scripts/tree/master/motioncam) and
[pycamera](https://github.com/akkana/scripts/tree/master/pycamera)
modules.

Everything here is licensed with the GNU Public License v.2 or, at
your option, any later GPL version.

Have fun!
